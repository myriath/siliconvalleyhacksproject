# Systemic Pandemic
Systemic Pandemic is a game focused around the leader of a country. Your job is to play as the leader and prevent Covid-19 from spreading through your country. You have to survive two weeks and balance the infection rate of your city with the economy and the public opinion, lest you get thrown out of office.

## Gameplay
Each day/night you are given a new bill to either pass or veto. You can also choose to quarantine/unquarantine a city each day. Your objective is to keep the infection below 10% by the end of the two weeks while keeping the economy running and a positive public image. Your choices for each bill will affect each of these things, so think carefully!

* ![infection](/assets/github/infection.png) - This bar shows you the overall infection of your country. This bar will fill up based on each city's infection. Drop this to zero to win! (or keep it below 10% by the end of your 2 weeks)
